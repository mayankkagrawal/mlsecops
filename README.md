# Secure of web server from Dos Attack using K-means Machine Learning Algorithm
Description:- Logstash which takes input from the server log and convert this input into csv format output once the csv file is updated we train our ML to find the Dos Attack uisng K-Means Clustering Algorithm after find the IP address we block the Ip that do DoS attack this whole process is automated using Jenkins CI/CD pipeline

Technologies Used:- Logstash, Machine Learning , Linux , Jenkins
